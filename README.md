# Personal Scripts Toolbox

A collection of small scripts I use (or might use) in the future.  
Mostly random utilities, but each one is standalone and documented.

## Structure

- `python/` – Python utilities.
- `shell/` – Shell scripts (bash/zsh-friendly).
- `js/` – Node/JS helpers.
- `archive/` – Old or experimental stuff.
